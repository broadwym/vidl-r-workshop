# vidl-r-workshop
VIDL workshop on ggplot2 and accompanying visualization libraries (February, 2018).
## ggplot2: Tutorial and Statistical Analysis
**Date**: February 28th, 2018

**Speaker**: Meredith Broadway meredith.broadway@owen.vanderbilt.edu 

### Description:
In this VIDL workshop, we'll learn how to leaverage R's ggplot2 (and complimentary libraries) to create effective data visualization. 

Two complimentary visualization libraries we'll be using: **GGally** and **hexbin**. 

Additional libraries we'll need to manipulate data: **dplyr**, **MASS**, **tidyr**, and **lubridate**. 

### Data pre-processing: 
The Nazi data was collected by: Jarausch, Konrad H., and Gerhard Arminger. "The German Teaching Profession and Nazi Party Membership: A Demographic Logit Model." *Journal of Interdisciplinary History* 20, no. 2 (1989): 197. doi:10.2307/204832. 

Jarausch and Arminger's raw data is contained in a .txt file called "nazi_raw." The description of the data is contained in a .txt file called "nazi_raw_description." 

I tidied and transformed the data into a .csv called "nazi." The script I used to clean the data is called "nazi_clean.R." I used nazi.csv for all data analysis and visualization.
